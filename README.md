Custom Cipher and Decipher
This repository contains Python scripts for a simple custom text cipher and decipher program.

Custom Cipher
Overview
The custom_cipher function takes a plaintext input and encrypts it using a random shift. Even positions in the text are encrypted using a simple Caesar cipher, while odd positions are replaced with symbols.
Custom Decipher
Overview
The custom_decipher function reverses the encryption process, decrypting the text back to its original form. It takes the encrypted text as input and returns the decrypted version.
How to Run
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Run the cipher script by executing python custom_cipher.py.
Run the decipher script by executing python custom_decipher.py.
Note: Make sure both scripts are in the same directory.

Feel free to use and modify these scripts for your encryption and decryption needs.
